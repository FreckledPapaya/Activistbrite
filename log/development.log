ActionController::UnknownFormat - RootController#root is missing a template for this request format and variant.

request.formats: ["text/html"]

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.:

Let's connect in a beautiful oasis, create a pop-up community together for a weekend of art, music, laughter, and queer magic.\n\n        This festival was born out of community necessity and striving to bring a wide array of voices and talents from our communities back to those who might need those connections most. That's why we're hosting Queeries in the Grey Bruce county this year, in Grand Valley, near Orangeville. The past two years we've experienced an alarmingly high 2SLGBTQ+ youth suicide rate in the region, we've lost a number of friends, participants, and young community members and I know we've all felt the collective heartbreak with how the current socio-political climate has been shifting here. There's a lot of work to do, but the road is arduous. And though Guelph Pride, the hosting organization for this festival, is putting in the work by revamping the way we do our work, bringing more voices to the table and into leadership positions, and shifting our focus to really support those who need us most, we also recognize that there are other sides to advocacy and activism that are often overlooked.\n\n        The road is long, and there is much work to do, but pride celebrations specifically have always been a place of simultaneous celebration and backlash, of authenticity and activism, of fighting like hell but being absolutely fabulous while doing it.\n\n        While we embrace the hard work necessary to make change in our communities, we also need to prioritize time to reconnect to those communities, for rest, for celebration, and for coming together on this land that sustains us.\n\n        And this was the inspiration and motivation behind Queeries - to bring people together, to foster an intentional community for change, and to create a space of celebration for our cultures and communities outside of the heavily commercialized pride festivals.\n\n        That's why we're keeping it grassroots this year - we did not and will not be accepting any corporate sponsorship for this festival. We are accountable to none but ourselves and our incredible partners - the Ridge LGBT campground, Make it Wright of Owen Sound, and DIRTYBOOTS creative. Queeries is also being run as an extension of Guelph Pride, which is a not for profit charitable organization run entirely by volunteers.\n\n        Yes, that's right - none of the organizers of the Queeries festival are being paid. It's run entirely by volunteers. All of the money raised is going towards offsetting costs, paying artists, offering subsidized/free tickets, offering meals to volunteers, and everything left over will be donated back to local, not-for-profit 2SLGBTQ+ serving charities.\n\n        So, thank you for your interest in helping us make this happen, and we can't wait to see you at the Ridge!"], ["created_at", "2019-07-11 06:31:03.554800"], ["updated_at", "2019-07-11 06:31:03.554800"], ["organizer_id", 90], ["start_date", "2020-06-19 17:00:00"], ["end_date", "2020-06-22 02:00:00"], ["image_url", "event_3"]]

Let's connect in a beautiful oasis, create a pop-up community together for a weekend of art, music, laughter, and queer magic.\n\n        This festival was born out of community necessity and striving to bring a wide array of voices and talents from our communities back to those who might need those connections most. That's why we're hosting Queeries in the Grey Bruce county this year, in Grand Valley, near Orangeville. The past two years we've experienced an alarmingly high 2SLGBTQ+ youth suicide rate in the region, we've lost a number of friends, participants, and young community members and I know we've all felt the collective heartbreak with how the current socio-political climate has been shifting here. There's a lot of work to do, but the road is arduous. And though Guelph Pride, the hosting organization for this festival, is putting in the work by revamping the way we do our work, bringing more voices to the table and into leadership positions, and shifting our focus to really support those who need us most, we also recognize that there are other sides to advocacy and activism that are often overlooked.\n\n        The road is long, and there is much work to do, but pride celebrations specifically have always been a place of simultaneous celebration and backlash, of authenticity and activism, of fighting like hell but being absolutely fabulous while doing it.\n\n        While we embrace the hard work necessary to make change in our communities, we also need to prioritize time to reconnect to those communities, for rest, for celebration, and for coming together on this land that sustains us.\n\n        And this was the inspiration and motivation behind Queeries - to bring people together, to foster an intentional community for change, and to create a space of celebration for our cultures and communities outside of the heavily commercialized pride festivals.\n\n        That's why we're keeping it grassroots this year - we did not and will not be accepting any corporate sponsorship for this festival. We are accountable to none but ourselves and our incredible partners - the Ridge LGBT campground, Make it Wright of Owen Sound, and DIRTYBOOTS creative. Queeries is also being run as an extension of Guelph Pride, which is a not for profit charitable organization run entirely by volunteers.\n\n        Yes, that's right - none of the organizers of the Queeries festival are being paid. It's run entirely by volunteers. All of the money raised is going towards offsetting costs, paying artists, offering subsidized/free tickets, offering meals to volunteers, and everything left over will be donated back to local, not-for-profit 2SLGBTQ+ serving charities.\n\n        So, thank you for your interest in helping us make this happen, and we can't wait to see you at the Ridge!"], ["created_at", "2019-08-09 17:22:33.569555"], ["updated_at", "2019-08-09 17:22:33.569555"], ["organizer_id", 15], ["start_date", "2020-06-19 17:00:00"], ["end_date", "2020-06-22 02:00:00"], ["image_url", "event_3"]]
